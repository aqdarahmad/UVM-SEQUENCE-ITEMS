Sequence Item, Constraints, and Randomization in UVM
 Sequence Item

A sequence item is a UVM class derived from uvm_sequence_item. It represents a transaction that transfers data between the sequence and the driver. Sequence items usually contain fields that define the details of the operation, and they serve as the basic unit of communication in a UVM testbench.

 Constraints

Constraints are rules applied to randomized variables to ensure they generate meaningful or valid values. Without constraints, randomized fields can take any legal value, but with constraints, you can control ranges, relationships, and conditions to fit your test scenarios.

 Randomization

Randomization in UVM allows automatic generation of variable values to increase test coverage. It helps explore corner cases and unexpected scenarios. Randomization combined with constraints ensures generated data is both valid and diverse, making the verification process more powerful and efficient.
